## Features

### Recipe Revamp, Notes, and Filters

We've revamped the look and feel of recipes to provide more details for you recipes.  First, we've combined the two sections into one, clean page.  Second, you can now add notes when you make a recipe, such as what you changed or did differently, as well as giving it a difficulty and rating.  The recipe's difficulty and rating is now the average of your notes.  Finally, we've added the ability to filter for tags when using the Surprise Me button under Cook > Schedules--Homechart will randomly choose a recipe that matches the tags you provided.  Don't get stuck scrolling through recipes, roll the dice and let Homechart pick for you!

### Daily Agendas

Homechart can now send you daily agendas at a specific time, every day. These notifications give you an overview of what's coming up.  Visit Settings > Notifications to enable it.

### Populate Shopping List from Inventory

We've made it really simple to add shopping list items from your inventory.
