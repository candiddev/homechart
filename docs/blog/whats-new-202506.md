## Deprecations

- We've removed the Astronomy, Canada, UK, and US holiday calendars that shipped with Homechart for now.  We recommend users use an existing iCalendar provider for holidays, as you'll have more control over the events and notifications.  See [Export/Import Calendars]({{% ref "/docs/guides/calendar#icalendar-providers" %}}) for a list of iCalendar providers.

## Features

### Accessibility Improvements

We've modified the Homechart user interface to be more compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

## Enhancements

- Calendar and Home > Agenda can now pick dates using the date picker dropdown.
- Calendar and Home > Agenda now hide event details by default.  Hovering over the event will expand them, as well as tapping the Expand Events button.
- Table column selection has been moved to the top left table column.
- Updated Go to 1.24.4
