## Features

### Feature Voting Revamp

We overhauled Feature Voting to give you more visibility and provide us more ways of receiving feedback:

- Self-hosted users can now provide feedback!
- Users now upvote/downvote and see the ranking of features.

## Enhancements

- Added the Romanian leu currency.
- Calendar picker can now be hidden (and is hidden by default on mobile).
- Moved most Toolbar view toggles to a new Show menu in the top right.
- Page specific forms (like New Transaction under Budget > Transactions or New Item under Shop > Items) will now stay open after creating a new item until Close is tapped.  This should make adding new items faster and easier.
- Plan > Tasks can now be quickly added from within the same list.
- Self-hosted accounts will now be verified automatically.
- Self-hosted users can now create Homechart Cloud households directly without manual linking.

## Fixes

- Fixed latest changes from other users not appearing immediately when Homechart is closed/minimized, especially on mobile devices.
- Fixed changes to Household member names not appearing immediately.
- Fixed dragging to be a lot more reliable.
- Fixed Bookmark form not using the correct input type.
- Fixed Cook > Recipes missing ingredients when added to the Shop > Items.
