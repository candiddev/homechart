## Features

### In Stock Recipe Ingredients

Recipes will now show icon@inventory next to ingredients that exist (and have a quantity greater than 0) in your Inventory.

### Import Cookbooks and Other Printed Text

Homechart learned to read!  Using your camera, you can now take pictures of text (like cookbooks, bills, or instructions) and Homechart will do a pretty good job of reading the text from it.  To get started, look for the Import Picture link when editing items.

### Undo Changes

You can now undo most changes within Homechart.  Accidentally completed a task, mistakenly changed a recipe?  Just click the undo button to revert your change.

### Custom Meal/Task/Transaction Event Colors

Calendar is now more colorful--Meal, Task, and Transaction events have a separate color scheme associated with them.  Visit Settings > Household to change the default.
