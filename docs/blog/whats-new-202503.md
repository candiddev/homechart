## Deprecations

## Features

### Database View

You can now view most of the objects in Homechart under one "database view" via Database.  In the very near future, you'll be able to use this view to manage granular permissions.

### Labels

You can now add Labels to certain objects in Homechart.  In the future, these labels will be used to grant or revoke access to things, as well as organize objects into dashboards and workspaces.

## Enhancements

- Added TLS authentication support to the HTTP server and client
- Plan > Tasks can now be sorted per-project by Due Date, Name, or Priority (default)
- Plan > Tasks can now be quick added under Today and Upcoming
