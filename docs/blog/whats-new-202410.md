## Enhancements

- Added the Czech Koruna currency.
- Changed Budget > Transactions to show remaining amount when adding categories/splitting a transaction.
- Changed the menu to show objects under the household name, instead of "Household".

## Fixes

- Fixed a bunch of UI issues with having multiple households.
- Fixed instances where Homechart wouldn't show up-to-date details (like Shop > Items or Plan > Tasks) across devices or household members unless it's closed/refreshed manually.  If you still notice Homechart behaving this way, please contact us as there may be more scenarios that need to be fixed.

## Removals

- Removed tabs for Plan > Tasks.
