title: Partner Acceptance Factor
---

An extremely common scenario we see with households adopting Homechart is:

- Technically-savvy partner discovers Homechart and starts using it
- Technically-savvy partner adds their not technically-savvy partner to Homechart
- Not technically-savvy partner struggles adapting their workflows to Homechart

We call this struggle the **Partner Acceptance Factor**.

## UX Design

Homechart's user interface design is primarily for power users who want a simple interface to manage their data that stays out of their way.  Unfortunately, current UX trends are focused on obfuscating complexity with non-obvious swiping or hidden menus.  This can lead to new user frustration from partners who are unsure or overwhelmed by Homechart's more verbose layout.

## Improving Partner Acceptance Factor

We prioritize work on any issue that impacts Partner Acceptance, including:

- Dramatically different functionality between Homechart and similar applications
- Missing documentation
- Paper-based workflow gaps
- Partner "show stoppers" that limit any interest or desire in using Homechart
- User interface bugs

If you encounter any of these, please {{% contactus "Homechart%20Partner%20Acceptance%20Issue" %}} immediately.
