Calendar helps you see everything going on in your Household.

## Automatic Refresh

The Calendar screen will automatically refresh, making it perfect for a tablet or kiosk.  The refresh times are:

- **Every minute**: Update the current time
- **Every 30 minutes**: Update the current date range (e.g. if you flip to the next week, Calendar will move back to the current week automatically)

You can combine the Calendar view and [Session Permissions]({{% ref "/docs/guides/settings#session-permissions" %}}) to have a limited access, shared "digital calendar" on a tablet or other device.

## Events

Events are things that are happening within your household.

### Participants

Events can have participants, members of your household that will be at the event.  When this is set, only those members will be notified of the Event, and the Event will use the [household member's colors]({{< ref "/docs/guides/settings#household" >}}).

### Location and Travel

Adding a **Location** to the event will give you a handy Google Maps link for directions to the location.  You can also add **Travel Time** for an event to have Homechart calculate a **Leave By** time and notify you on when you need to leave.

### Recurring Events

Events can be recurring by ticking **Recurring** at the bottom.  You can then set the recurring schedule.

### Reminders

Events can send multiple reminders before the event starts or ends.  These can be added under **Reminders**.

## Export/Import Calendars

Homechart can export your calendar for use with other calendaring applications via ICS/iCalendar Feed.  Tap **Add > Export Calendar** to get a URL that you can add to your calendaring tool.

Likewise, Homechart can import calendars from other applications that expose an ICS/iCalendar Feed.  Tap **Add > Import Calendars** to add them.

### iCalendar Providers

We recommend the following iCalendar providers for additional Calendars like weather, holidays, or religious observances:
