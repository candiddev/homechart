1. Sign into Homechart
1. Tap "Install Homechart" on the left-hand menu
1. Homechart should now be installed on your device

Homechart will automatically update to the latest version, there's nothing else you need to do.

## Self-Hosting

Homechart Self-Hosted is when you host Homechart on your server.  It's easy to install, update, and manage, and your data never leaves your network.  You should be familiar with Linux and PostgreSQL.

If you want to use Homechart Self-Hosted, continue to [Self-Hosted Homechart]({{< ref "/docs/guides/get-homechart/self-hosted" >}})
