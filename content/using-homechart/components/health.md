# Health

Health helps you and your family log the way you feel, the food you eat, and the symptoms you have to help you discover correlations between your health and your environment.  Health is great for tracking your own health, but you and your spouse can use it to track your child's health, too.  In a household, Household Owners can manage a child's health data, but they can't see each other's data.

I added Health to Homechart because I wanted to track food allergies in a private, secure way.  There are a lot of apps in the various app stores that do this, and they all seemed to have questionable privacy policies.  I also wanted to do simple correlation tracking, and not have to remember to track everything _exactly when it happens_.

## Inputs and Outputs

You use Health > Inputs and Health > Outputs when you create a Health > Log.

### Inputs

Health > Inputs are typically things that you or your household member eat, medications taken, or possibly environments.  Homechart comes with common allergens and problem foods out of the box.

### Outputs

Health > Outputs represent how you or your household member feel.  Homechart comes with common allergy symptoms out of the box.

### Correlations

After you've created a few Health > Logs, Homechart will start calculating correlations between your outputs and inputs.  The way Homechart does this isn't complicated: for each Output you Log, Homechart will look back at the Inputs you logged previous and add a correlation.

You'll likely see a lot of Correlations over time, the best way to interpret it is to look for things with the _highest number_ of correlations.  Correlations are removed over time, so things with a high correlation should remain high.

## Logs

Health > Logs are the way you record an Input or an Output occurring.  Logs are date specific, so you can enter all of your Inputs/Outputs at the end of the day if necessary.  You create Logs in [Calendar](../calendar).

## Integrations

Health integrates with:

- [Calendar](../calendar): Health > Logs are managed and displayed in **Calendar**
