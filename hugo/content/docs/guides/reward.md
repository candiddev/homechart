Reward helps your household do positive reinforcement.

## Cards

Reward > Cards represent tasks that need to completed a certain number of times to receive a reward.  They can also represent a limited number rewards that can be redeemed.

### Senders and Recipients {#sender}

You will assign certain household members as **Senders** and **Recipients**:

- **Senders** have access to edit, punch, and redeem the Card
- **Recipients** can view the Card

### In Progress and Redeemable

Cards that are In Progress have not yet earned enough punches to become Redeemable.  Once a card is Redeemable, the [Sender](#sender) can either Redeem/Delete the Card or Reset the Card to start the process over.

### Always Redeemable

Cards can be changed so the punches are actually redeemable charges.  Think of it like a gift card, where you could give your kids 20 minutes of screen time, 5 times.  Tap **Always Redeemable** to make a card work this way.
