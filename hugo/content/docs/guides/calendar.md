Calendar helps you see everything going on in your Household.

## Events

Events are things that are happening within your household.

### Participants

Events can have participants, members of your household that will be at the event.  When this is set, only those members will be notified of the Event, and the Event will use the [household member's colors]({{< ref "/docs/guides/settings#household" >}}).

### Location and Travel

Adding a **Location** to the event will give you a handy Google Maps link for directions to the location.  You can also add **Travel Time** for an event to have Homechart calculate a **Leave By** time and notify you on when you need to leave.

### Recurring Events

Events can be recurring by ticking **Recurring** at the bottom.  You can then set the recurring schedule.

## Export/Import Calendars

Homechart can export your calendar for use with other calendaring applications via ICS/iCalendar Feed.  Tap **Export Calendar** to get a URL that you can add to your calendaring tool.

Likewise, Homechart can import calendars from other applications that expose an ICS/iCalendar Feed.  Tap **Import Calendars** to add them.

## Other Calendars

For your convenience, Homechart comes with a few calendars for common holidays and events.  Please contact us if you'd like to see another Calendar added.
