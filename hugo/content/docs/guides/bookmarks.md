Bookmarks help you manage links to other apps and services.  You can create personal or household bookmarks, show and hide Bookmarks in the **Home** and **Menu**, and control how the Bookmark apps open within Homechart.

## Use Image for Icon

You can have an image like a favicon or the logo for the app be displayed instead of an icon for Bookmarks.  Tick **Use Image as Icon** and enter a URL.

## Open Bookmark in a New Window

By default, Homechart will render the Bookmark as an iframe--the Bookmark will be displayed "within" Homechart's layout.  This may not work for all websites due to security measures like CORS.  You can disable this feature by ticking **Open in New Window** while editing or creating a Bookmark.

## Show on Home

Personal and Household Bookmarks can be displayed in the Home and Menu by ticking **Show on Home** while editing or creating a Bookmark.  For Household Bookmarks, ticking this will show the Bookmark for all members of your household.
