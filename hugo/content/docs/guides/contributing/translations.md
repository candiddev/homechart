Translating Homechart is an ongoing process.  You can help us out by [updating or adding translations](#updating-or-adding-translations) or contacting support with the language you want or corrected translations.

## Updating or Adding Translations

We use [yaml8n](https://yaml8n.dev) for our translations.

Homechart generates translations from the [translations.yaml](https://github.com/candiddev/homechart/blob/main/yaml8n/homechart.yaml) file.  It's a big file, but it lets you see _everything_ there is to translate in Homechart.

There are additional shared translations that Homchart uses in [shared_web.yaml](https://github.com/candiddev/shared/blob/main/yaml8n/shared_web.yaml)

### Syntax

Checkout the [yaml8n docs](https://yaml8n.dev/docs/references/translations) for more information.

The syntax for the file is easy to understand:

{{< highlight yaml >}}
defaultcode: en # English is the default/fallback language
iso639codes: # A list of the ISO-639 codes and the display name for them
  de: Deutsch
  en: English
translations: # A list of translation objects.  The objects contain context and a translation for each of the iso639codes
  EmailEmailAddressChangeConfirmationSubject:
    context: Subject for email address changes
    de: '[Aktion erforderlich] Best√§tigen Sie Ihre aktualisierte E-Mail-Adresse'
    en: |
      [Action Required] Verify Your Updated Email Address
{{< /highlight >}}

### Adding a new language

To add a new language, please contact us.  You can add it to the translations.yaml, but we have tooling that can generate the translations first and then have you review them.

### Updating translations

You can update the translations if you notice something in Homechart that isn't translated correctly.  Checkout this [git repo](https://github.com/candiddev/homechart) (or the [shared one](https://github.com/candiddev/shared) for shared translations) and open a pull request with your changes.  You should be able to search the document to find the original translation.
