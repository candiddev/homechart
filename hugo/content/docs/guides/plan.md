Plan helps you track personal and household Projects and Tasks in one spot.

## Projects

Plan > Projects are typically where Tasks belong, though they can be found under a general Personal or Household bucket too.  A Project is a collection of other Projects, [Shop > Items](../shop#items), and Tasks.  Projects can be associated with [Budget > Category](../budget#categories).

## Tasks

Plan > Tasks are a thing that you or your household needs to do.  Tasks can contain other Tasks (Sub Tasks).  Task **Names** and **Details** use [Markdown](../markdown), so they can link to things within or outside Homechart if necessary.  Tasks can have a **Due Date**, **Due Time**, and a **Duration**.  Setting these values will have the Task appear in [Calendar](../calendar), and you'll receive [Settings > Notifications](../setings#notifications) for them.

You can make tasks recur by setting a **Due Date** and ticking **Recurring**.  Tasks can either recur on their **Due Date**, or you can tick **Recur Based on Completion Date** to have the task recur on the date when you actually complete it.

Tasks can reference an [Inventory > Item](../inventory#items), so you can associate maintenance tasks with your Lawn Mower.

### Templates

Tasks can be converted to Personal or Household **Templates**, Tasks (and sub-tasks) that can be easily copied like a packing list for a vacation.

- [Budget](../budget): Plan > Projects can be associated with a **Budget > Category**
