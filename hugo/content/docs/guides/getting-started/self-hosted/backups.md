Please remember to backup your data! Self-hosted Homechart is easy to backup: all persistent data is stored in PostgreSQL, Homechart doesnâ€™t save anything locally. You can use tools like pg_dump or wal-g to perform the backup.

Additionally, you can have your self-hosted instance perform automated, encrypted backups to Homechart Cloud. Visit `/subscription` on your self-hosted instance to enable this.
