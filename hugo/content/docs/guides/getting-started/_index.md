Before you start using Homechart, you need to decide on where you'll be using it.

## Use Homechart Cloud

[Homechart Cloud](https://web.homechart.app) is a hosted version of Homechart managed by us.  It's already setup, always up to date, and we handle backups, security, and stability.

If you want to use Homechart Cloud, continue to [Sign Up for Homechart Cloud](/docs/guides/getting-started/sign-up)

## Use Homechart Self-Hosted

Homechart Self-Hosted is when you host Homechart on your own devices.  It's easy to install, update, and manage, and your data never leaves your network.  You should be familiar with Linux and PostgreSQL.
