## Features

### Google Assistant Support

You can now talk to Homechart using Google Assistant.  Find out what your agenda is, what meals are scheduled, and more.  Visit the [Assistant Directory](https://assistant.google.com/services/invoke/uid/0000007618b6ba0) to get started.

### Permissions Revamp

We've add support for more permission scenarios.  You can now allow a device to access only household items and not your personal ones (and vice versa).  Use this with your Google Home or shared tablet to limit what other people can access while using it.

### Referral Revamp

We've made it even easier to refer your friends and family to Homechart.  Visit Settings > Cloud to learn more!
