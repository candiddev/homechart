## Features

### New Homechart Look and Feel

We've worked closely with users and designers to build a better user interface (and logo!) for Homechart.

## Enhancements

- Calendar now displays dots underneath dates that have events, tasks, meals, or transactions scheduled
- Self-hosted instances can now use the Android and iOS apps without Homechart Cloud
Wiki is now Notes
