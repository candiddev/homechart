## Features

### UI Refresh
We've refreshed the UI to be more consistent and accessible.

### Schedules Calendar View
Cook > Schedules now looks like a real calendar.  This is the first step for the expanded calendaring functionality coming in future releases.

### Global Search
A global search has been added.  Use this to find items throughout Homechart.

### Sharing
If you have Homechart installed on your phone or tablet, you can now share websites to it.  Homechart can import the website as recipe or a task.

### Import Recipe from URL
Import > Recipe from URL has been added.  Point Homechart at a URL and instantly add the recipe to your collection.

### Live Updates
When using Homechart with other people, you'll now see their updates immediately.  This is handy for when you're both shopping or working on tasks."
