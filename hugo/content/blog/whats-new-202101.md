## Features

### iPad and iPhone App Launch

Homechart launches on the App Store with native notifications on iPad and iPhone.

### Self-Hosted Server Picker

We've made it easier to select a self-hosted Homechart server in our Android and iOS apps.

### Sign in with Apple Support

Users can now now sign into Homechart with their Apple IDs.  Existing users can switch their account to use this under Settings > Account.

### Meal Planning Randomizer

Not sure what to plan for dinner?  Homechart can help by randomly selecting for you!  Pancakes for dinner, why not?

### Calendar Tasks, Toggles, and Transactions

You can now see recurring tasks and transactions further out in Calendar, and we've added toggles to hide/show Meals, Tasks and Transactions.
