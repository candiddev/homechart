## Features

### Inventory Launch

We've added Inventory, a highly flexible, simple to use way to catalog and filter items all over your house.  Keep an inventory of your ingredients, electronics, warranties, and more.  With a built in UPC scanner, it'll make it very simple to stay on top of what's in stock and what isn't.  In the very near future, expect tighter integration with Recipe management and Budgeting.

### Tagging Improvements

We've improved the experience adding and removing tags, expect to see more tagging support across Homechart in the future.

### Column Toggles and Filters

While developing the Inventory component, we decided to add column toggles and filters across the product.  This will make it easier to customize your recipes, budgets and more the way you want.
