## Features

### UI Updates

We've updated the Homechart UI to better serve our users.

### Shop > Item Prices

You can now add prices to Shop > Items, and Shop > Lists and Plan > Projects will calculate the total cost of items within them.

### Shop > List and Budget > Category Integration

Shop > Lists can now be associated with Budget > Categories like Plan > Projects. They will both show you how much you need to save to afford the items within them.

### Plan > Project Durations

Plan > Projects now show the total time it will take to complete all of the tasks within them based on the durations.
