## Features

### Automated Self Hosted Licensing
Self hosted users can now automatically have their Homechart instances retrieve licenses.  Visit https://hub.docker.com/r/candiddev/homechart for more information.

### Event Participants
You can now add household members as participants to Calendar > Events, letting you easily where everyone is during the week.

### Help Pages
Get help while using Homechart by selecting icon@help in the top right.  You can also search across help pages to get the answers you're looking for.  As always, we're here to help if you get stuck too.

### Household Permissions
Members of your household can now have permissions limited to specific components under Settings > Household.  Use this to give your kids (or spouse) access to Homechart, but prevent them from viewing or changing your budget.

### Shopping Staples
Setup recurring shopping list items using Shopping > Staples.  These items will automatically be added to your shopping list when it's time to purchase them.
