## Features

### Improved UI Experience

We've updated the UI to be more comfortable and consistent.  We've also overhauled the internals to make Homechart faster and more responsive.  We've also added black and white to the color list for themes.

### Revamped Home Screen and Custom Bookmarks

Home is now completely customizable.  You can add custom bookmarks for yourself and your household, such as links to your media server or other applications.  You can also hide existing bookmarks and components to only display the ones you use regularly.

### Homechart Knows Who's Cooking Dinner

Cook > Schedules can now have an optional chef assigned to the meal.  This helps families coordinate who's responsible for meals that night, and Homechart will only send reminders to the chef.
