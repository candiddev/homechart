{{% alert title="Deprecation Warning" color="warning" %}}
We are changing our environment variable format.  The old format of uppercase snake case `HOMECHART_CLI_DEBUG` will no longer work in future versions.  Please convert your environment variables to camel case snake case (`HOMECHART_cli_logLevel`).  Visit [the config docs]({{< ref "/docs/references/config" >}}) for more information.
{{% /alert %}}
