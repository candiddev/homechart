## Features

### Shopping Items inside Projects

Plan can now include Shop > Items in projects.  Keep track of what you need to purchase for that staining the deck project or the birthday party next weekend.

### Household Member Calendar Colors

Each household member can have a default Calendar Event color set for them under Settings > Household.  Use this to visually organize your Calendar based on your household.

### Child Accounts

You can now create limited access Child Accounts under Settings > Household.  These accounts can't sign in on their own--you sign in first and switch to them.  Perfect for adding the entire family to your calendar events and tasks.

### New Android App

We've reworked the Android app to offer a more native experience.
